-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* For this project I created a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.
* Using JavaScript, I created an array of phrases and wrote functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.
* Each time the player guesses a letter it is compared with the random phrase.
* A player can guess a letter only once, after they've guessed a letter it is disabled.
* If the user's guessed letter is in the phrase, the game board shows the selected letters.
* If the letter they chose isn't in the phrase, one of the player's five lives is removed.
* If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display.
* If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen will display.
